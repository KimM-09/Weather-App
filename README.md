# Check the weather by city application

## Applicaiton Summary
This is a simple weather checking application that calls upon an openweathermap.org API key
and returns the result to the screen. By default, it displays only the search box. Once a 
valid city name is input, it will return the current weather, temperature (in celcius),
humidity, and wind speed. If an invalid city name is entered it will display an error message
"Invalid city name"
